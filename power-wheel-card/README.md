power-wheel-card
====

An intuÃ¯tive way to represent the power and energy that your home is consuming or producing.
> This component is discussed [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/lovelace-power-wheel-card/82374) on the Home Assistant forum.

## Features
Features of the custom power-wheel-card:
* Displays the three values (solar, grid and home) in 'a wheel'.
* Has different views for showing power values, showing energy values and showing costs/savings: the *power view*, the *energy view* resp. the *money view*.
  The initial view can be set. Click the unit to switch between views.
* Calculates the current power that you nett consume from the grid: grid power.
  Input for the calculation is the consumed grid power and the produced grid power.
* Calculates the current power that your home is consuming: home power.
  Input for the calculation is the (produced) solar power and the consumed and produced grid power.
* Calculates the energy that you nett did consume from the grid: grid energy.
  Input for the calculation is the consumed grid energy and the produced grid energy.
* Calculates the energy that your home is consuming: home energy.
  Input for the calculation is the (produced) solar energy and the consumed and produced grid energy.
* Calculates the costs/savings for all the energy values.
* Displays the transition between these power, energy and money values as arrows.
  E.g. if your solar power panels produce power, the arrow from solar to home turns active.
  And if your solar power panels produce enough power to deliver some back to the grid, the arrow from solar to grid turns active.
* Arrows can have values next to them. Zero values are suppressed. And values on the arrows are visible only when relevant. E.g. on a sunny day when part of your produced solar panel energy was returned to the grid and the other part was consumed by your home.
* Optionally uses icons of your own choice, which can be set by card parameters or taken from your `customize:` sensor settings.
* Optionally colors the consuming icons yellow and the producing icons green. You can choose your own colors for consuming and producing.
* Works for default theme and custom themes that use [standard CSS vars](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/blob/master/src/resources/ha-style.js).
* Has support for [custom_updater](https://github.com/custom-components/custom_updater) custom component to check for new release via the custom tracker-card.

## Requirements for the *power view*
1. You need to have a working sensor for your solar power. Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_SOLAR_POWER_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - The sensor could have an icon (optional) that will override the default icon in the power-wheel-card if the card parameter `solar_icon` is not used.
1. You need to have a working sensor for your grid power consumption.
   Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_GRID_POWER_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - Preferably this sensor has the same update interval as the sensor for solar power. (If not, the calculated value for home power can give unreal results sometimes.)
1. You need to have a working sensor for your grid power production.
   Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_GRID_POWER_PRODUCTION_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - Preferably this sensor has the same update interval as the sensor for solar power. (If not, the calculated value for home power can give unreal results sometimes.)
1. For all these sensors:
    - A `unit_of_measurement` has been set up, e.g. `'W'` or `'kW'`.
    - The `unit_of_measurement` is the same as the other power sensors.
    - The sensor state should always be parsable to an *int* or *float* value.
    - The sensor state value should be positive.

You don't need a sensor for your (nett) grid power but you can use it if you have it available and want to use its icon. The value for grid power always will be calculated.

You don't need a sensor for your home power, but you can use it if you have it available and want to use its icon. The value for home power always will be calculated. 

### Example requirements configuration
This is not the configuration of the power-wheel-card itself, but an example configuration that's needed to have input sensors for the power-wheel-card.
An example configuration in `configuration.yaml` to comply to the requirements:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      solar_power:
        friendly_name: 'Solar power production'
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        value_template: >-
          {{ state_attr("sensor.youless", "pwr") }}
      grid_power_consumption:
        friendly_name: 'Grid power consumption'
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        value_template: >-
          {{ (1000 * (states("sensor.power_consumption") | float) | int }}
      grid_power_production:
        friendly_name: 'Grid power production'
        unit_of_measurement: 'W'
        value_template: >-
          {{ (1000 * (states("sensor.power_production") | float) | int }}
```

In this example the sensors names for *YOUR_SOLAR_POWER_SENSOR*, *YOUR_GRID_POWER_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR* and *YOUR_GRID_POWER_PRODUCTION_SENSOR* are `solar_power`, `grid_power_consumption` resp. `grid_power_production`.

Not visible in the example above, but of course you have to have installed the hardware and configured it to feed your sensors.
In the example above I used a [rest sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.rest/) for my [Youless](http://youless.nl/winkel/product/ls120.html) for the solar power.
For the grid power I used a [dsmr sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.dsmr/) for my Iskra Smart Meter.
Because my solar power sensor and dsmr sensor don't report in the same unit of measurement, I had to convert that.

> **Tip.** If you are creating extra sensors for the power-wheel-card, maybe you want to exclude them in your `recorder:` setting.
Extra sensors based on your heavily updating DSMR sensors will let your database grow fast. 

## Requirements for the *energy view*
The *energy view* itself is not required. As a result you don't have to specify any *energy view* related card parameters. 
The toggle function to switch between views will be disabled.

> **Tip.** You can skip this paragraph and [start](#instructions) with a more simple setup first. 

But if you want the *energy view*:
1. Comply to all the requirements of the *power view* first.
1. Decide what kind of energy sensors you want to use. You could use your *smart meter counters* directly, but using self made sensors for e.g. *energy consumed or produced since last midnight* could provide more meaningful information on your power-wheel-card.
Especially since a future release will be able to convert the values into costs and savings. Then you would be able to see the actual energy costs/savings today. 
1. You need to have a working sensor for your solar energy. Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_SOLAR_ENERGY_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - The sensor could have an icon (optional) that will override the default icon in the power-wheel-card if the card parameter `solar_icon` is not used.
1. You need to have a working sensor for your grid energy consumption. Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_GRID_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - Preferably this sensor has the same update interval as the sensor for solar energy. (If not, the calculated value for home energy can give unreal results sometimes.)
1. You need to have a working sensor for your grid energy production. Write down the entity id of this sensor. This is *YOUR_GRID_ENERGY_PRODUCTION_SENSOR* in the instructions below.
    - Preferably this sensor has the same update interval as the sensor for solar energy. (If not, the calculated value for home energy can give unreal results sometimes.)
1. For all these sensors:
    - A `unit_of_measurement` has been set up, e.g. `'Wh'` or `'kWh'`.
    - The `unit_of_measurement` is the same as the other energy sensors.
    - The sensor state should always be parsable to an *int* or *float* value.
    - The sensor state value should be positive.

You don't need a sensor for your (nett) grid energy but you can use it if you have it available and want to use its icon. The value for grid energy always will be calculated.

You don't need a sensor for your home energy, but you can use it if you have it available and want to use its icon. The value for home energy always will be calculated.

## Requirements for the *money view*
The *money view* itself is not required. As a result you don't have to specify any *money view* related card parameters. 
The toggle function to switch to the *money view* will be disabled.

But if you want the *money view*:
1. Comply to all the requirements of the *energy view* first.
2. Supply the card parameter `energy_price`.


## Instructions
1. Check the requirements above. If you don't comply to the requirements, the card won't be much of use for you or just won't work.
1. Download the file [power-wheel-card.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gurbyz/custom-cards-lovelace/master/power-wheel-card/power-wheel-card.js).
1. Save the file in the `www` folder inside your Home Assistant config folder.
1. Include the card code in your `ui-lovelace.yaml` file:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/power-wheel-card.js?v=1
    type: module
```

> **Note.** The actual number in `v=A_NUMBER` isn't relevant. You have to increase the number whenever updating the source code to avoid having to manually clear the cache of your browsers and mobile apps.

5. Include a configuration for the power-wheel-card in your `ui-lovelace.yaml` file:

```yaml
views:
  - id: example_view
    cards:
      - type: "custom:power-wheel-card"
        solar_power_entity: sensor.YOUR_SOLAR_POWER_SENSOR
        grid_power_consumption_entity: sensor.YOUR_GRID_POWER_CONSUMPTION_SENSOR
        grid_power_production_entity: sensor.YOUR_GRID_POWER_PRODUCTION_SENSOR
        color_icons: true
```

There are many more card parameters available, but it's advised to start with this simple setup to get things running.

### More about icons
The icons for solar and grid can be set by card parameters as shown in the tables above.
If you don't specify them as card parameters, the icons are taken from your own sensors for solar power and grid power (in the *power view*) and from your own sensors for solar energy and grid energy (in the *energy view* and *money view*).
You could have specified those with the `customize:` option for `homeassistant` in your `configuration.yaml`.

If you haven't set up any icons for them, default icons will be used in all views. For solar: `mdi:weather-sunny`; and for grid: `mdi:flash-circle`.

An example for reusing the icons of your sensors used in the *power view*, to be put in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    sensor.YOUR_SOLAR_POWER_SENSOR:
      icon: mdi:white-balance-sunny
    sensor.YOUR_GRID_POWER_SENSOR:
      icon: mdi:flash
```
